# 404_59_web_server_js
This repository was created as part of my ECEN 403/404 Senior Design year-long project.  The purpose of this repository is to contain the code used to host a Node.js web server.  The web server is hosted through Heroku, with this repo being a copy of what is pushed and hosted there.  An Android application and an ESP32 module will be connecting to this web server.

## Functionality of this web server
- Connect to a PostgreSQL database hosted through Heroku
- Display tables on website from database
- Process queries to add rows to tables
- Process HTTPS URL requests to add rows to tables
- Summarize packages into session entries
